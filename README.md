# Lorem Ipsum Paragraph Generator

This project is a simple React application that generates a specified number of paragraphs from a sample data array. It allows users to enter a number and retrieve that many paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum text. This is helpful for developers who need placeholder text for layouts and designs.

## Project Overview

The app provides a form with an input box where users can specify the number of paragraphs (up to a maximum of 8) they want to generate. Once the form is submitted, the app renders the specified number of paragraphs from a pre-defined array of placeholder text stored in `data.js`.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Usage

1. Enter the number of paragraphs you need (between 1 and 8) in the input box.
2. Click the "Generate" button to display the requested number of paragraphs.

## Code Explanation

The main components of the code are:

- **State Management**: The app uses `useState` to handle two state variables:
  - `count`: Represents the number of paragraphs to display, initialized to 1.
  - `text`: Holds the array of paragraphs that will be rendered.

- **Form Submission**: The `handleSubmit` function is triggered on form submission, preventing the default page refresh. It converts the `count` state to a number using `parseInt` and then updates the `text` state with the first `count` elements from the `data` array.

- **Dynamic Rendering**: Inside the `article` element, the app maps over the `text` array, rendering each paragraph with a unique key generated by `nanoid` to ensure React efficiently handles re-renders.

Hereâ€™s the relevant snippet from the code:

```javascript
const handleSubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const amount = parseInt(count);
  setText(data.slice(0, amount));
};
```

The `nanoid` library is used here to generate unique keys for each paragraph, ensuring unique identifiers without collisions.

```sh
npm i nanoid
```

```js
import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';

const id = nanoid(); // Generates a 21-character random ID

console.log(id); // Output: "Uakgb_J5m9g-0JDMbcJqL"
```
